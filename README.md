# Rdio CLI

A simple command line interface for [Rdio][]. Requires the desktop app to be
installed since playback controls talk to the app via AppleScript.

## Installation

```
gem install rdio-cli
```

## Usage

Rdio CLI is powered by [GLI][] and has a Git-like (sub)command interface:

```bash
$ rdio current
Now playing: All The Roadrunning / Mark Knopfler And Emmylou Harris / Real Live Roadrunning
```

```bash
$ rdio current "♫ %{track} ♫"
♫ All The Roadrunning ♫
```
